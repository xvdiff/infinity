# infinity - 8chan on the go

*infinity* is a Android based 8chan client that lets you conveniently browse
8chan (aka *masterchan*) on your smartphone / tablet while you're on the go,
at your mom's place or hiding from your boss on the toilet.

The app originated from a fork of the open-source 4chan browser [Clover by Floens](https://github.com/Floens/Clover). Show
